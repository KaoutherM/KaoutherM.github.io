Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at Télécom Paris, working on research at the intersection of deep learning, generative models, and autonomous systems. My work focuses on leveraging large-scale multimodal data, representation learning, and cross-domain generalization to advance autonomous vehicle intelligence. I am also increasingly exploring video understanding and its applications to dynamic scene modeling.

Before joining Télécom Paris, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [VITA](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/) Lab, [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en). I earned my Ph.D. in 2021 from Sorbonne University, France, where I conducted research on Deep Learning for Motion Prediction at the [RITS Lab](https://team.inria.fr/rits/), [INRIA Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-paris-centre).
